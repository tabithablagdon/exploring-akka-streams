### Overview

Akka Streams provides a high level API for stream processing into composable, deconstructable pieces. 
It provides an abstraction over the Reactive Streams protocol, using Akka's existing Actor model under the hood. 

This project is composed of prompts and exercises to help you 
explore [Akka Streams](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/index.html) 
patterns and ease you into thinking about streaming systems.
